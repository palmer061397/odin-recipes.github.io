    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (3/4 inch) thick pork chops</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 medium tart apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons pecans (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a medium baking dish into the oven and preheat to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li><br>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brush chops lightly with oil and place into the hot pan. Cook until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer to the baking dish in the preheated oven to keep warm.</li><br>
      <li>Stir brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.</li><br>
      <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in apples and brown sugar mixture. Cover and cook until apples are just tender, about 5 minutes. Leaving the sauce in the skillet, remove apples with a slotted spoon and arrange over pork chops; keep warm in the oven.</li><br>
      <li>Continue to cook sauce, uncovered, until thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li><br>
      <li>Remove pork chops from the oven. Spoon sauce over top and sprinkle with pecans.</li><br>
    </ol>
